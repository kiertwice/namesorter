# namesorter
An program that takes a text file of names, sorts them, and saves the sorted list to a new text file

The program looks for a text file named "unsorted-names-list.txt" saved in the same directory as the executable, but this can easily be changed.

If found, it will read each line of the text file, print the unsorted list to console, then sort it, print the sorted list, and save it to the current directory
as "sorted-names-list.txt"
